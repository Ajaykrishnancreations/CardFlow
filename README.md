## 🔑 Development Test Accounts (DEV Environment Only)

For instant local testing, three fixed accounts are pre-configured:

| User Role | Mobile Number | Fixed DEV OTP | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Normal User** | `1234567890` | `123456` | Search directory, scan cards, manage Card Vault, send enquiries |
| **Business Owner** | `9876543210` | `123456` | Manage multiple businesses, QR counter display, enquiries, analytics |
| **Admin** | `9999988888` | `123456` | In-app KYC review queue, moderation, user management, audit logs |

> **⚠️ Security Guard:** These fixed test credentials are strictly disabled when `ENV=production`. In production, OTPs are dispatched via an SMS gateway.
